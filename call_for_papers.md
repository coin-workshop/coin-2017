# COIN 2017

Current ICT solutions exhibit unprecedented levels of sophistication, only achievable via the interconnection of hundreds or thousands of software components. In many scenarios, these components are supplied by third parties and they may come and go (i.e., we have an open ecosystem of components), they may have various degrees of autonomy (i.e., they may not “do as told”), and they interact with one another as well as with digital and physical assets, whilst competing and/or collaborating to achieve individual and global goals. 
The design, engineering, analysis and verification (among other activities) of such systems require novel metaphors, formalisms, mechanisms, techniques, and tools stemming from the study of coordination, organisations, (artificial and electronic) institutions, and norms. More recently, a new generation of socio-technical systems, combining human and software participants and components, raise the importance of the study of the topics within the remit of the proposed workshop.
The proposed workshop, a long-standing satellite event of past versions of AAMAS, IJCAI and ECAI for more than 10 years, is to bring together researchers and practitioners in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative (multi-agent) systems, artificial or electronic institutions and norm-aware agents.
We seek to attract papers on:

- mathematical, logical, computational, philosophical and pragmatic issues related to the topics above;
- modelling, animation and simulation techniques for open MAS;
- exploration of the topics above in socio-technical systems;
- tools, prototypes and real-life systems adopting COIN-related approaches;
- experimental investigation of the effectiveness of COIN-related technologies;
- human-oriented representation and application of COIN-related topics (e.g., norms in natural language for humans, norms and coordination for practical planning);
- challenging or innovative ideas relevant to the field.


Of particular interest for the workshop are those papers that articulate a challenging or innovative view.
