# Call for Papers

We seek to attract papers on:

- mathematical, logical, computational, philosophical and pragmatic issues related to the topics above;
- modelling, animation and simulation techniques for open MAS;
- exploration of the topics above in socio-technical systems;
- tools, prototypes and real-life systems adopting COIN-related approaches;
- experimental investigation of the effectiveness of COIN-related technologies;
- human-oriented representation and application of COIN-related topics (e.g., norms in natural language for humans, norms and coordination for practical planning);
- challenging or innovative ideas relevant to the field.


Of particular interest for the workshop are those papers that articulate a challenging or innovative view. 
COIN is ranked B on the CORE Conference Ranking list: [http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/2160/](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/2160/)

## Instructions for Authors

For preparation of papers please follow the instructions for authors available at the Springer LNCS Web page. The length of each paper including figures and references may not exceed 16 pages. All papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format. 

For submission of papers, please use the EasyChair site at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coin2017](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coin2017)

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the workshop to present the work. 


## Proceedings
Preliminary proceedings will be available before the conference. They will also be distributed to AAMAS 2017 registrants in electronic form. 

As with previous COIN workshops, we will have an LNCS postproceedings. Authors will be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their paper for consideration for a Springer LNCS volume combining the postproceedings of this workshop with those for a second COIN workshop to be held later in 2017. 

Revised papers must take into account the discussion held during the workshop; hence, only papers that are presented during the workshop will be considered for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume.
