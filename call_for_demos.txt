Call for Demos
==============

We are inviting proposals for demonstrations to be displayed at the Demo
Session that will be organised during the COIN@AAMAS 2017 workshop. We
expect submissions of demos of agent and multi-agent systems that
incorporate state-of-the-art techniques and novel application domains,
and provide an innovative intelligent user interface. Demonstrated
software is not required to be ready for commercial application, as long
as it is of interest to the COIN community.

A demo proposal needs to describe:

-   the motivation for the demonstrated concepts;
-   the software design behind the demo;
-   the development and functionality of the work in an interactive
    setting;
-   the significance of the contribution both from a research and from a
    practical perspective.

The COIN 2017 Demo Session will provide researchers and practitioners an
exciting and highly interactive way to explore new ideas and results.

Accepted demo papers will be published in the COIN 2017 Workshop
Proceedings.

Submission Guidelines
---------------------

The demonstration submissions must be within four pages in AAMAS
proceedings style (double-column pages) and must include:

-   Title
-   Authors (name, affiliation, email, address, phone and fax)
-   Corresponding author with her/his email address
-   Abstract (max. 150 words)
-   Keywords
-   Category of the submission
-   URL for the demo software (if available)
-   Paper ID if the demo is related to a paper at the main conference
-   Equipment you will bring (e.g. laptop, projector)
-   Equipment you will need (e.g. table, poster board, power sockets)
-   Special requirements (e.g. extra space and if so how much,
    video projector)
-   Discussion of the present state of your demo (e.g. ready to
    demonstrate now, but if not, include a realistic estimate for
    conclusion and what remains to be done before you have a
    demonstrable system)

Demos must be submitted electronically to the EasyChair online
submission system at:
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coin2017>.
